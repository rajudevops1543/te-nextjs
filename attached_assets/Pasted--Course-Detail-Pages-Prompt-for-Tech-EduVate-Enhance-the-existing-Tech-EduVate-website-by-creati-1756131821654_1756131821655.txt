# Course Detail Pages Prompt for Tech EduVate

Enhance the existing Tech EduVate website by creating **dynamic course detail pages** for all 5 courses.  

## Requirements
- When a visitor clicks **"Learn More"** on any course card in `/courses` page, they should be redirected to that course’s detail page.  
- Use **React Router** for navigation (e.g., `/courses/devops`, `/courses/devsecops`, `/courses/aws`, `/courses/azure`, `/courses/gcp`).  
- Each course page should reuse the **same professional layout** with different content.  
- The design must match the homepage (style, animations, colors).  

---

## Course Detail Page Layout
### Hero Section
- Large heading: Course Name (e.g., *DevOps Mastery*).  
- Background gradient animation.  
- Short subtitle tagline (e.g., *“Master CI/CD, Kubernetes, and Infrastructure as Code.”*).  

### About the Course
- 2–3 paragraphs explaining the course.  

### Course Outline (Expandable Accordion or List)
- List all modules and topics.  
- Each module should expand/collapse for readability.  

### Duration & Pricing
- Show clear details like:  
  - Duration: *10 weeks*  
  - Price: *₹19,999* (adjust per course).  

### What You’ll Learn
- Bullet list of learning outcomes (skills, certifications, projects).  

### Enroll & Payment Section
- Prominent **"Enroll Now"** button.  
- Payment integration placeholder (Stripe/PayPal).  
- Simple form (Name, Email, Phone).  

### Call-to-Action
- Motivational banner: *“Take the next step in your career with Tech EduVate!”*  
- CTA button: **Enroll Today**.  

### Footer
- Same global footer with logo, links, social icons.

## Technical Implementation
1. Update **React Router** in `App.jsx` (or equivalent) to add 5 new routes:  
   - `/courses/devops`  
   - `/courses/devsecops`  
   - `/courses/aws`  
   - `/courses/azure`  
   - `/courses/gcp`  

2. Each route should render a **CourseDetail component** with props (title, description, outline, duration, price).  

3. On the **Courses Page**, make the **"Learn More"** button on each card link to the corresponding detail page.  

4. Payment section:  
   - Add a styled checkout card with **Stripe/PayPal placeholder**.  
   - Keep design consistent (hover effects, button animations).
